    <p><b>What is the ShakeThatMouse privacy policy?</b></p>
    <p>- We donâ€™t collect any data.</p>
    
    <p><b>I don't agree with the app moving my cursor!</b></p>
    <p>It is fine. You can use the Quiet Mode. It will prevent your screen going to sleep.</p>
    <p><b>The app asks for permission to move your cursor, only.</b></p>
    <p>For this, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility -> Check ShakeThatMouse app</p>
